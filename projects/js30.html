    <h2>Javascript 30</h2>
    <p><a href='https://javascript30.com/'>Javascript 30</a> is a thirty day challenge created by Wes Bos.</p> <p>The challenge is to create thirty mini projects using vanilla JS in thirty days!</p>
    <p>Wes gives an HTML and CSS template to start with and then it's up to me to finish each project.</p>


    <!-- INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS -->
    <!-- DAY 1 -->
    <div class='project-template'>
      <h3>Day 1 - (1/15/23) - <a href='/projects/JS30/Day1_Drum_Kit/index.html'>JS Drum Kit</a></h3>

      <a href='/projects/JS30/Day1_Drum_Kit/index.html'><img class='project-page-img left-float' src='/projects/JS30/Day1_Drum_Kit/day1.png' alt='day 1 javascript drum kit'></a>

      <a href='/projects/JS30/Day1_Drum_Kit/index.html' class='project-links'><p>go to project</p></a>

      <p>This was a great first project. It is a simple design and it was straightforward to work with.</p>
      <p>Take aways from this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More practice with <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes'>data attributes</a>.</li>
        <li>Learned about the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement'>HTMLMediaElement</a> and the <a href='https://gomakethings.com/how-to-play-a-sound-with-javascript/'>Audio constructor</a>.</li>
        <li>Learned about the <kbd>kbd</kbd> keyboard element.</li>
        <li>Learned about the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionend_event'>transitionend</a> event.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My additions to this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The keyboard in the original project only responds to keypress events. I added the ability to click on each letter to hear the sound.</li>
        <li>Made the design responsive for mobile and tablet layouts. This was pretty easy to do with <code>flex-wrap</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If I were to extend the functionality of this app, I could:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allow the user to record the beats they make and send themselves the audio file. I would follow <a href='https://ralzohairi.medium.com/audio-recording-in-javascript-96eed45b75ee'>this guide</a>.</li>
        <li>Add a metronome sound that can be adjusted to the desired speed to help the user make beats. I would need to research how to do this.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- DAY 2 -->
    <div class='project-template'>
      <h3>Day 2 - (1/16/23) - <a href='/projects/JS30/Day2_Clock/index.html'>JS Clock</a></h3>

      <a href='/projects/JS30/Day2_Clock/index.html'><img class='project-page-img left-float' src='/projects/JS30/Day2_Clock/day2.png' alt='day 2 javascript clock'></a>

      <a href='' class='project-links'><p>github repo</p></a>
      <a href='/projects/JS30/Day2_Clock/index.html' class='project-links'><p>go to project</p></a>

      <p>Wes gave the clock design and it was my job to make the hands move according to the time. I am learning a lot by looking at his HTML and CSS and seeing what properties he used to accomplish this clean look. This project was pretty light on the JS and relied mostly on CSS.</p>
      <p>Take aways from this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice working with the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date'>Date constructor</a> and the methods available to it.</li>
        <li>Used <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval'>setInterval</a> to refresh the clock every second.</li>
        <li>Learned about the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function'>transition-timing-function</a> property and how to control the speed of an animation or transition.</li>
        <li>Learned how to adjust different cubic-bezier values in Chrome Developer Tools to get the desired custom values. This is how the seconds hand animates each second but slightly comes back to its previous position with each tick.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My additions to this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I added the current date to the clock. Used a <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index'>z-index</a> so that the hands don't go "over" the date as they cycle through the element.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <!-- DAY 3 -->
    <div class='project-template'>
      <h3>Day 3 - (1/17/23) - <a href='/projects/JS30/Day3_CSS_Variables/index.html'>CSS Variables & JS</a></h3>

      <a href='/projects/JS30/Day3_CSS_Variables/index.html'><img class='project-page-img left-float' src='/projects/JS30/Day3_CSS_Variables/day3.png' alt='day 3 css variables'></a>

      <a href='' class='project-links'><p>github repo</p></a>
      <a href='/projects/JS30/Day3_CSS_Variables/index.html' class='project-links'><p>go to project</p></a>

      <p>Wes gave the starting design and it was my job to get the form input values with Javascript and make the website adjust to the actions specified by the user. The challenge focused on using CSS variables with Javascript. I learned a lot from reading the HTML and CSS that Wes set up for this project.</p>
      <p>Take aways from this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I knew about the range form input but I didn't know about the <code><a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color'>color</a></code> form input that pulls up a color wheel. It's so cool that the functionality comes out of the box with HTML. I also reviewed some other <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input'> form input types</a> to get inspired for what I can use on future projects.</li>
        <li>This project taught me how to use CSS variables. First, you declare the variable at the highest element in the CSS file which is <code>:root</code>. Variable names start with a double dash (for example <code>--color: #fff</code>). When you want to use a variable on a CSS property, you reference the variable with the <code>var</code> keyword (for example <code>color: var(--color)</code>. Full documentation is <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties'>available here</a>.</li>
        <li>I didn't know too much about the <a href='- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/documentElement'>root element</a> of the DOM before this project. I learned that you can access it with <code>document.documentElement</code> in Javascript and <code>:root</code> in CSS as mentioned above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My additions to this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I could have added more elements to alter the image.</li>
        <li>I made the design mobile responsive by adding the <code>object-fit: cover</code> property on the image selector and adjusted some of the spacing issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- DAY 4 -->
    <div class='project-template'>
      <h3>Day 4 - (1/18/23) - JS Array Practice</h3>

      <img class='project-page-img left-float' src='/images/JS30.png' alt='day 3 css variables'>

      <a href='' class='project-links'><p>github repo</p></a>

      <p>This wasn't a project but rather some small problems on Arrays to solve with vanilla Javascript. The challenge focused on using Array methods like <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>sort</code>. Nothing that Launch School didn't cover in the 101 course!</p>
